# Escape VR
A escape room made in Unity in 2021 designed for VR in mind though due to covid and lockdown in 2021 we were not able to access the equipment to properly test in VR. Though it was desgined with VR in mind in terms of controls, though for the purpose of the demo I used first person wasd movement not teleportation, though it is programmed into the game

My contribution:
I programmed the whole game. The movement, controls, puzzles, logic, and created the materials. 
While my teammates made some assets in blender, sourced some other free ones, or edited free assets. Though many of them were made all by hand.
